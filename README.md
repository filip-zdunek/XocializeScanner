XocializeScanner
================

Native IOS barcode scanner for Cordova.  Requires IOS 7 for AV Foundation native barcode implementation.

Important
=========

This is a very basic barcode scanner and one of my very first plugins.  Much could be horribly wrong but at least it's working for me.  Feel free to fork and improve.

Installation
============

To add the barcode scanner to your Cordova project install with the command line tools:

cordova plugin add https://github.com/dunielson/XocializeScanner
